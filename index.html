<h1>Brian Nguyen</h1>

<p>I'm from the Bay — San Jose to be specific.</p>
    
<p>Before this, I was working on start ups for Advance Publications, and before that I was taking pictures and making visuals for the Chicago Tribune.</p>

<p> I'm pretty much self taught in journalism — it's my first time taking journalism classes of any kind. Originally when I first graduated, I was planning on grad school, but it just never happened. I kept looking for the chance to go but one thing led to the next (start ups will do that) and then it felt like grad school was never gonna happen.</p>
    
<p>Along the way, I started becoming obsessed with how open source investigations were being used in stories — first with Bellingcat, then with the New York Times visual foresics team. I couldn't get it out of my head. I applied to see where it would take me, and now here I am. </p>
